```js
   cordova.plugins.barcodeScanner.scan(
      function (result) {
          alert("We got a barcode\n" +
                "Result: " + result.text + "\n" +
                "Format: " + result.format + "\n" +
                "Cancelled: " + result.cancelled);
      },
      function (error) {
          alert("Scanning failed: " + error);
      },
      {
          "preferFrontCamera" : true, // iOS and Android
          "showFlipCameraButton" : true, // iOS and Android
          "prompt" : "Place a barcode inside the scan area", // supported on Android only
          "formats" : "QR_CODE,PDF_417", // default: all but PDF_417 and RSS_EXPANDED
          "orientation" : "landscape" // Android only (portrait|landscape), default unset so it rotates with the device
      }
   );
```

## Encoding a Barcode ##

The plugin creates the object `cordova.plugins.barcodeScanner` with the method `encode(type, data, success, fail)`.

Supported encoding types:

* TEXT_TYPE
* EMAIL_TYPE
* PHONE_TYPE
* SMS_TYPE

```
A full example could be:

   cordova.plugins.barcodeScanner.encode(cordova.plugins.barcodeScanner.Encode.TEXT_TYPE, "http://www.nytimes.com", function(success) {
            alert("encode success: " + success);
          }, function(fail) {
            alert("encoding failed: " + fail);
          }
        );
```
